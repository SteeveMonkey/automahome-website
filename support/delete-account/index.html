	<h1>Deleting your account</h1>
	<p>Once you delete your AutomaHome account, all of your associated data is deleted as well. This data includes your
		login credentials and name. This will also delete any homes you own, so any users that have been invited to a
		home that you are the owner of will lose access once you delete your account.</p>
	<!-- 
	<h2>In the app</h2>
	<p>The quickest and easiest way to delete your account is to do so from the app</p>
	 -->

	<h3>Open the app</h3>
	<p>First, open the app and ensure that the account you are trying to delete is currently logged in. If not, then
		sign out of the current account and sign into the one that you want to delete.</p>

	<h3>Navigate to account settings</h3>
	<p>Open the navigation drawer by tapping the hamburger menu at the top of the screen, then tap "Settings" near the
		bottom of the drawer, and then tap the "Account" tab located near the top of the screen.</p>

	<h3>Delete the account</h3>
	<p>Press the red "Delete Account" button at the bottom of the screen and confirm to confirm that you are actually
		trying to delete your account and all of it's associated data.</p>

	<!-- 
	<h2>Request via email</h2>
	<p>It is also possible to request account deletion via email</p>
	 -->
